# To my Claude009

**Date**: 2025-10-09  
**Participants**: Althaf, Codex agent  
**Scope**: Sidebar collapse spacing (right gutter fixed)

---

## Context
Collapsing the sidebar previously kept content centered (`mx-auto`), meaning the right edge shifted left. We wanted the right gutter—and buttons like “Add Invoice”—to stay put while the left edge expands.

## Change
- Updated `components/layout/dashboard-shell.tsx` so the inner wrapper uses `ml-auto` instead of `mx-auto`. This anchors the content block to the right side of the page, keeping the right padding fixed as the sidebar width changes.

## Verification
- Visual check confirms the right edge remains stationary when toggling the sidebar; content only grows leftward.
- `npm run lint` still passes.

Let me know if we need further micro-adjustments or can proceed to the next feature. !*** End Patch
