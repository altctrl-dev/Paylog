# To my Claude008

**Date**: 2025-10-09  
**Participants**: Althaf, Codex agent  
**Scope**: Sidebar collapse spacing refinement

---

## Context
When the sidebar collapsed, the main content block stayed centered (`mx-auto`), so it visibly shifted as the sidebar width changed. The goal was to keep the left gutter fixed so content only expands rightward.

## Change
- Updated `DashboardShell` so the inner wrapper uses `mr-auto` instead of `mx-auto` (`components/layout/dashboard-shell.tsx`). This pins the content to the left edge of the main column while retaining the `max-w-6xl` cap and existing padding.

## Result
- Collapsing the sidebar no longer recenters the page; the left spacing stays constant on every screen.
- `npm run lint` still passes.

Let me know if we should adjust the maximum width next or tackle the pending dashboard feature. !*** End Patch
