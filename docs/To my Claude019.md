# To my Claude019

**Date**: 2025-10-09  
**Participants**: Althaf, Codex agent  
**Scope**: Header/Sidebar polish (branding + user menu)

---

## Changes
1. **Header branding**
   - Replaced the “Welcome back” block with a fixed PayLog brand line (`Invoice Management Console`).
   - Header now receives only collapse/toggle props; user details moved to sidebar footer.

2. **Sidebar layout**
   - Removed the logo card, added a navigation label, tightened padding, and introduced tooltips for collapsed mode.
   - Active nav pill uses the neutral highlight; hover state is a softer neutral.

3. **User profile footer**
   - Added initials-based avatar, name/role stack, and a sign-out button anchored at the bottom (moves sign-out out of the header).
   - Avatar shows initials in both expanded/collapsed states; role text auto-formats underscores.

## Files
- `components/layout/header.tsx`
- `components/layout/sidebar.tsx`
- `components/layout/dashboard-shell.tsx`

## Notes
- Theme toggle stays in the header; sign-out action now lives in the sidebar footer.
- Lint passes with existing warnings (`admin-request-review-panel.tsx`).

Let me know if you want to tweak the badge colors or add a dropdown for profile actions later.
