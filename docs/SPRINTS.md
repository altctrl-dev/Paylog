### Technical Highlights
- **Email System**: Resend integration with defensive initialization, retry logic, preview mode
- **Master Data**: Single table design (MasterDataRequest), state machine workflow (draft â†’ pending â†’ approved/rejected)
- **Fire-and-Forget Pattern**: Non-blocking email sending to prevent workflow interruption
- **Panel Integration**: Leverages Sprint 2's stacked panel system
- **RBAC**: Standard users create requests, admins approve/reject

### Acceptance Criteria
- âœ… Email notifications trigger on submit, approve, reject actions
- âœ… Templates render with clean HTML layout and plain text fallback
- âœ… Standard user can request all 4 entity types (Vendor, Category, Profile, Payment Type)
- âœ… Admin can approve requests (creates entity in database)
- âœ… Admin can reject requests with reason
- âœ… Rejection allows resubmission (max 3 attempts enforced)
- âœ… Email preview mode works for development testing
- âœ… Service fails gracefully when email provider not configured

### Implementation Notes
- **Scope Reduction**: Originally planned 26 SP with React Email, queue system, and advanced features. Delivered 13 SP focused on core email notifications using simplified architecture.
- **Defensive Service**: EmailService initializes without throwing on missing API key, preventing module load failures
- **Preview Mode**: EMAIL_PREVIEW=true logs email content to console instead of sending, perfect for development
- **Environment Variables**: Leading spaces in .env file caused configuration issues (fixed during implementation)
- **Singleton Pattern**: EmailService requires full server restart to pick up new environment variables

### Debugging Session (October 15, 2025)
- **Issue**: Email notifications not triggering on form submission
- **Root Cause**: Form called `createRequest()` with `pending_approval` status directly, but function had no email logic
- **Fix**: Added email notification to `createRequest()` when `status === 'pending_approval'` (lines 194-211)
- **Testing**: Verified working with Resend testing domain (`onboarding@resend.dev`)
- **Configuration**: `EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev`, `EMAIL_PREVIEW=false`
- **Result**: âœ… Emails successfully delivered to admin inboxes
- **Documentation**: Complete debugging workflow captured in docs/SESSION_HANDOFF_OCT15.md

### Production Email Setup
**Current**: Using Resend testing domain (`onboarding@resend.dev`) - works immediately, no DNS required
**Future**: To use custom domain (`notifications@servsys.com`):
1. Add domain in Resend dashboard (https://resend.com/domains)
2. Add DNS records (DKIM, SPF, MX) to DNS provider
3. Wait for verification (5-30 minutes)
4. Update `.env`: `EMAIL_FROM=notifications@servsys.com`
5. Restart server

### Acceptance Criteria
- âœ… Vendors/categories cannot be archived if linked to invoices
- âœ… Archive functionality implemented with invoice count validation
- âœ… Autocomplete shows active vendors/categories only
- âœ… Invoice counts accurate and performant (eager loading with Prisma `_count`)
- âœ… RBAC enforced (admin-only mutations, read-only for associates)
- âœ… All quality gates passed (lint, typecheck, build)

### Technical Highlights
- **12 Server Actions**: Full CRUD with RBAC enforcement (app/actions/master-data.ts)
- **React Query Hooks**: 12 custom hooks for data fetching and mutations (hooks/use-vendors.ts, hooks/use-categories.ts)
- **Autocomplete Components**: cmdk + Radix Popover for searchable dropdowns
- **Eager Loading**: Prisma `_count` for efficient invoice count aggregation
- **Archive Safety**: Server-side validation prevents deletion of entities with invoices
- **Panel Integration**: Leverages Sprint 2's stacked panel system (Level 2 forms)
- **Case Sensitivity**: SQLite limitation documented (PostgreSQL migration needed for case-insensitive)

### Implementation Summary
- **Phase 1**: Requirements clarification (RC agent) - minimal fields, simple archive, eager loading
- **Phase 2**: Change navigation (CN agent) - discovered existing schema, no migration needed
- **Phase 3**: Database planning (DME agent) - confirmed schema exists, marked complete
- **Phase 4**: Core implementation (IE agent) - 11 new files (2,152 lines), 3 modified files
- **Phase 7**: Quality checks - lint âœ…, typecheck âœ…, build âœ…
- **Bug Fix**: Panel routing in PanelProvider (vendor/category forms not rendering)

### Files Created (11 files, 2,152 lines)
**Server Actions**:
- app/actions/master-data.ts (796 lines) - 12 server actions with RBAC

**React Query Hooks**:
- hooks/use-vendors.ts (227 lines) - 6 custom hooks for vendor operations

### Quality Metrics
- âœ… Lint: Passed (6 warnings - 4 ARIA in autocomplete, 2 pre-existing)
- âœ… TypeCheck: Clean for Sprint 8 code
- âœ… Build: Success (production bundle created)
- âœ… Runtime: All features working (vendor/category create/edit/archive)
- âœ… Regressions: None (all Sprint 1-7 features intact)

### Known Limitations
- **Case-Insensitive Search**: Not supported in SQLite (PostgreSQL migration needed)
- **Request New Entity**: Deferred to Sprint 9 (archive request workflow)
- **Activity Logging**: Deferred to Sprint 10 (audit trail for master data changes)

### Story Point Adjustment
- Originally estimated: 13 SP
