**Duration**: Completed Oct 15, 2025
**Goal**: Implement email notification system and enable users to request new master data with admin approval workflow

**Note**: Originally planned as 26 SP with comprehensive email infrastructure and master data workflow. Actual implementation focused on core email notifications (13 SP) using simplified architecture that meets immediate business needs.

### Part A: Email Notifications (8 SP) - COMPLETE

  - New request email to admins
  - Resubmission email to admins
- [x] Master data approval triggers (app/actions/admin/master-data-approval.ts:242-256, 344-358)
  - Approval email to requester
  - Rejection email to requester
- [x] Non-blocking email sending (no workflow interruption on email failures)

#### Configuration
- [x] Environment variable setup (.env:9-14)
  - EMAIL_ENABLED flag
  - RESEND_API_KEY configuration
  - EMAIL_FROM sender address
  - ADMIN_EMAILS comma-separated list
  - EMAIL_PREVIEW mode for testing
- [x] Dependencies installed (resend@^4.8.0)

### Part B: User-Created Master Data (5 SP) - COMPLETE

#### Core Infrastructure - COMPLETE
- [x] MasterDataRequest Server Actions (app/actions/master-data-requests.ts)
  - [x] `createRequest()` - Create draft request
  - [x] `submitRequest()` - Submit for approval with email notification
  - [x] `resubmitRequest()` - Resubmit rejected request
  - [x] `updateRequest()` - Update draft
  - [x] `deleteRequest()` - Delete draft only
  - [x] `getUserRequests()` - Get user's requests with filtering
- [x] Admin Server Actions (app/actions/admin/master-data-approval.ts)
  - [x] `getAdminRequests()` - Get all pending requests

- [x] Request creation forms for all entity types (Vendor, Category, Profile, Payment Type)
- [x] Request list with status badges
- [x] Request detail panels
- [x] Draft/Pending/Approved/Rejected status workflow

#### Admin Review UI - COMPLETE
- [x] Admin page "Master Data Requests" section
- [x] Pending requests list with filtering
- [x] Review panel with request details
- [x] Approve/Reject actions with confirmation
- [x] Admin notes and rejection reason capture

### Technical Highlights
- **Email System**: Resend integration with defensive initialization, retry logic, preview mode
- **Master Data**: Single table design (MasterDataRequest), state machine workflow (draft â†’ pending â†’ approved/rejected)
- **Fire-and-Forget Pattern**: Non-blocking email sending to prevent workflow interruption
- **Panel Integration**: Leverages Sprint 2's stacked panel system
- **RBAC**: Standard users create requests, admins approve/reject

### Acceptance Criteria
- âœ… Email notifications trigger on submit, approve, reject actions
- âœ… Templates render with clean HTML layout and plain text fallback
- âœ… Standard user can request all 4 entity types (Vendor, Category, Profile, Payment Type)
- âœ… Admin can approve requests (creates entity in database)
- âœ… Admin can reject requests with reason
- âœ… Rejection allows resubmission (max 3 attempts enforced)
- âœ… Email preview mode works for development testing
- âœ… Service fails gracefully when email provider not configured

### Implementation Notes
- **Scope Reduction**: Originally planned 26 SP with React Email, queue system, and advanced features. Delivered 13 SP focused on core email notifications using simplified architecture.
- **Defensive Service**: EmailService initializes without throwing on missing API key, preventing module load failures
- **Preview Mode**: EMAIL_PREVIEW=true logs email content to console instead of sending, perfect for development
- **Environment Variables**: Leading spaces in .env file caused configuration issues (fixed during implementation)
- **Singleton Pattern**: EmailService requires full server restart to pick up new environment variables

### Debugging Session (October 15, 2025)
- **Issue**: Email notifications not triggering on form submission
- **Root Cause**: Form called `createRequest()` with `pending_approval` status directly, but function had no email logic
- **Fix**: Added email notification to `createRequest()` when `status === 'pending_approval'` (lines 194-211)
- **Testing**: Verified working with Resend testing domain (`onboarding@resend.dev`)
- **Configuration**: `EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev`, `EMAIL_PREVIEW=false`
- **Result**: âœ… Emails successfully delivered to admin inboxes
- **Documentation**: Complete debugging workflow captured in docs/SESSION_HANDOFF_OCT15.md

### Production Email Setup
**Current**: Using Resend testing domain (`onboarding@resend.dev`) - works immediately, no DNS required
**Future**: To use custom domain (`notifications@servsys.com`):
1. Add domain in Resend dashboard (https://resend.com/domains)
2. Add DNS records (DKIM, SPF, MX) to DNS provider
3. Wait for verification (5-30 minutes)
4. Update `.env`: `EMAIL_FROM=notifications@servsys.com`
5. Restart server

- Created: lib/email/service.ts (14 KB, 396 lines)
- Created: lib/email/types.ts (1.9 KB)
- Created: lib/email/config.ts (1.5 KB)

- âœ… Files deleted when invoice deleted (cascade)
- âœ… File download works for all file types
- âœ… Comprehensive security validation (magic bytes, path traversal, authorization)

### Technical Highlights

- **Testing**: 161 tests with focus on security (96.73% validation coverage)

### Implementation Summary

#### Storage Layer (lib/storage/)
- `interface.ts`: IStorageService interface for provider abstraction
- `local.ts`: Local filesystem implementation with atomic writes
- `validation.ts`: MIME validation, file size checks, filename sanitization
- `factory.ts`: Provider factory pattern for easy S3/R2 migration
- `cleanup.ts`: Background cleanup utilities for soft-deleted files

#### Server Actions (app/actions/attachments.ts)
- `uploadAttachment()`: Upload with authorization and validation
- `deleteAttachment()`: Soft delete with permission checks
- `getAttachments()`: List with filtering and relations
- `canUploadAttachment()`: Pre-flight permission check

#### API Routes
- `GET/DELETE /api/attachments/[id]/route.ts`: Secure file serving with authorization

#### UI Components (components/attachments/)
- `file-upload.tsx`: Drag-and-drop upload with validation and progress
- `attachment-list.tsx`: Responsive grid layout (1-3 columns)
- `attachment-card.tsx`: Individual file display with actions
- `file-icon.tsx`: Type-based icons (PDF, images, documents)

#### Testing (__tests__/)
- `validation.test.ts`: 50+ tests (96.73% coverage)
- `local.test.ts`: 25+ tests (76.23% coverage)
- `attachments.test.ts`: 25+ tests (52.48% coverage)
- `file-upload.test.tsx`: 20+ tests (97.84% coverage)
- `attachments-security.test.ts`: 45+ security tests

### Security Measures Implemented
âœ… **Path Traversal Prevention**: Filename sanitization blocks `../`, absolute paths, null bytes
âœ… **MIME Spoofing Detection**: Magic bytes validation checks file content matches declared type
âœ… **Authorization Enforcement**: Permission checks before upload/download/delete
âœ… **Injection Attack Prevention**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection sanitization
âœ… **DoS Prevention**: File size limits (10MB), attachment count limits (10 per invoice)
âœ… **Audit Trail**: Soft delete preserves uploaded_by, deleted_by, timestamps

### Story Point Adjustment
- Originally estimated: 12 SP
- Actual delivery: 12 SP (on target)
- Scope: Local filesystem (MVP) instead of S3/R2 to accelerate delivery
- Security testing added beyond original scope

### Files Created/Modified
**Created**:
