## üîÑ What Changed from Original Plan?

### **Original Sprint 9** (Cancelled)
- ‚ùå Archive Request Workflow (11 SP)
- **Reason**: Standard users can't access admin-only master data, so archive request workflow doesn't make sense
- **Solution**: Admins use direct archive/unarchive via trash icon

### **New Sprints 9A + 9B** (Added)
- ‚úÖ Sprint 9A: Admin Reorganization & Enhanced Master Data (14 SP)
- ‚úÖ Sprint 9B: Invoice Profile Enhancement (12 SP)
- **Total**: 26 SP
- **Net Change**: +15 SP (26 - 11 = +15)

### **Project Impact**
- **Original Total**: 179 SP
- **Revised Total**: 183 SP (+4 SP)
- **Reason**: More comprehensive master data enhancements than originally planned
