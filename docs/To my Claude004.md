**Participants**: Althaf, Codex agent  
**Scope**: Header/Sidebar layout alignment & translucency check

## Conversation Highlights
- Asked to let the navbar span the full width and have the sidebar begin underneath to eliminate the misaligned border seam.
- Confirmed the navbar should remain subtly translucent; ensured styling still reads modern without being flashy.

## Issue
- Previous layout stacked the sidebar and main column side-by-side with the header inside the content column; this left overlapping borders where the sidebar met the navbar, producing a distracting cross seam.

## Resolution Steps
1. Refactored `DashboardShell` so the header renders at the top-level and the sidebar/main content sit in a flex row beneath it, eliminating overlap (`components/layout/dashboard-shell.tsx`).
2. Retained the single vertical divider by placing a border on the main content column only.
3. Kept the header’s translucent treatment (`bg-[hsl(var(--navbar))]/75` with backdrop blur), confirming it still reads cleanly after the layout change.
4. Re-ran `npm run lint` to ensure no regressions.

## Next Considerations
- Review mobile behavior to confirm the collapsible sidebar still behaves correctly now that it sits below the header.
- If needed, explore adding a subtle drop shadow to the header for more depth once content scrolls.
