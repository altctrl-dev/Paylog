**Topic**: Filter persistence decision

After weighing the options, sticking with **URL params only** is the best fit for now:

- Matches the existing filter behavior across the app.
- Keeps implementation simple—no new storage layer or edge cases to manage.
- Still lets users share bookmarked links with the current filter state.

If we later want “remember my filters” we can add a `localStorage` layer on top without breaking anything.

Ready to proceed with date filters using URL persistence whenever you give the signal.
