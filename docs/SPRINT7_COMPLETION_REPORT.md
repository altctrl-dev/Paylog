## Manual Testing Checklist

The following should be tested manually in the browser to verify full functionality:

### Activity Logging

- [ ] Create invoice → check activity log entry created
- [ ] Update invoice → check activity log shows old/new data
- [ ] Approve invoice → check activity log entry
- [ ] Reject invoice → check activity log with reason
- [ ] Put invoice on hold → check activity log entry
- [ ] Delete invoice → check activity log shows hidden
- [ ] View activity log as admin → see all logs
- [ ] View activity log as standard user → see only own actions
- [ ] Filter by action type → results update
- [ ] Filter by date range → results update
- [ ] Expand activity entry → see data diff
- [ ] Wait 30 seconds → verify auto-refresh

### Comments

- [ ] Add comment → appears immediately
- [ ] Edit comment → "Edited" badge appears
- [ ] Delete own comment → works
- [ ] Try to delete other's comment as standard user → denied
- [ ] Delete any comment as admin → works
- [ ] Use Markdown toolbar → bold/italic/list/link render correctly
- [ ] Character counter → warns at 2000 limit
- [ ] Pagination → next/previous work for >20 comments
- [ ] Activity log → comment actions logged

### Bulk Operations

- [ ] Select invoices → checkboxes work
- [ ] "Select All" → selects all on current page
- [ ] BulkActionBar → appears when selection made
- [ ] Clear selection → works
- [ ] Bulk approve as admin → all invoices change to unpaid
- [ ] Bulk reject as admin with reason → all invoices rejected
- [ ] Try bulk approve as standard user → denied
- [ ] Select invalid invoices (mix pending + paid) → pre-validation error
- [ ] Export to CSV → file downloads with correct data
- [ ] Column selector → choosing columns works
- [ ] CSV format → headers and data correct
- [ ] Activity log → bulk operations logged

### Integration

- [ ] All features work together without conflicts
- [ ] No regressions in Sprint 3-6 features (filtering, sorting, payments, etc.)
- [ ] Dark mode works across all new features
- [ ] Performance acceptable (no noticeable slowdowns)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **Test File Errors**: Pre-existing TypeScript errors in `__tests__/` files from Sprint 6 (attachment tests). These are test infrastructure issues, not production code issues.
2. **Exhaustive Deps Warnings**: 4 ESLint warnings in Sprint 3-6 code (admin/settings pages). These are acceptable and don't affect functionality.

### Limitations (By Design)
1. **Markdown Support**: Intentionally limited to basic formatting (bold, italic, lists, links) per RC requirements. Full Markdown support (images, code blocks, etc.) can be added later if needed.
2. **CSV Export**: Generates CSV client-side in browser. For very large datasets (>10,000 rows), server-side generation may be more appropriate.
3. **Activity Log Retention**: Logs kept forever with no archival strategy. In production, consider archiving old logs to cold storage after X months.

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Comment reactions/likes
- @mentions in comments
- Comment threads/replies
- Rich Markdown editor
- File attachments in comments
- Scheduled bulk operations
- Bulk operation templates
- Activity log export

---

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "@radix-ui/react-checkbox": "^1.3.3",
  "@radix-ui/react-dialog": "^1.1.15"
}
```

**Rationale**: Required for checkbox and dialog primitives following shadcn/ui patterns.
