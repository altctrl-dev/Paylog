## Performance Benchmarks

### Test Execution
- **Total Tests**: 161 (138 passing, 23 failing)
- **Execution Time**: ~2.3 seconds
- **Test Suites**: 5 (2 passing, 3 with failures)

### Coverage by Layer
- **Critical Security**: 96.73% (validation)
- **Storage Operations**: 76.23% (local storage)
- **UI Components**: 97.84% (file upload)
- **Server Actions**: 52.48% (integration tests)

## Known Issues / Limitations

### Failing Tests (23)
Most failures are due to:
1. **Invoice status mocking**: Tests expect different status values than mocked
2. **Validation error messages**: Expected error strings don't match actual
3. **Integration complexity**: Server action tests need better mock setup

### Not Tested
- Presentational components (attachment-card, attachment-list, file-icon)
- Background cleanup task (cleanup.ts)
- Factory pattern (factory.ts) - simple delegation

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Before Merge)
1. âœ… **Core security tests passing**: Path traversal, MIME spoofing, authorization
2. âœ… **Validation layer**: 96.73% coverage
3. âœ… **Storage layer**: 76.23% coverage
4. âœ… **UI component**: 97.84% coverage

### Future Improvements
1. **Fix failing integration tests**: Improve mock setup for Server Actions
2. **Add API route tests**: Test file serving endpoint with range requests
3. **Add E2E tests**: Full user journey with Playwright
